Given the growing recognition of the environment as a key determinant of physical and mental health, there is increasing need for scalable tools that enable the systematic integration of environmental data in biomedical research. </p> <p>CLUES addresses these needs by enabling selection and automated download of geospatial data from multiple sources, along with the harmonisation of datasets, standardising file formats, spatial and temporal coverage, and map projections to ensure interoperability and consistency across data layers. The CLUES database contains key environmental domains, characterising the built and natural environment, climate and extreme weather, air pollution, and regional socioeconomic conditions. Its framework is designed to be extensible, enabling addition of new environmental variables and ongoing integration of emerging datasets over time. </p> <p>CLUES adheres to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) principles. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#deployment","title":"Deployment","text":""},{"location":"#set-up-a-virtual-python-environment","title":"Set up a virtual python environment:","text":"<p>python -m venv cluesEnv</p>"},{"location":"#activate-virtual-environment","title":"Activate virtual environment:","text":"<p>Linux:</p> <p>source cluesEnv/bin/activate</p> <p>Windows:</p> <p>cluesEnv\\Scripts\\activate</p>"},{"location":"#install-dependicies","title":"Install dependicies:","text":"<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p> <p>snakemake must be installed seperatly  </p> <p>*pip install snakemake *</p>"},{"location":"#config","title":"Config","text":"<p>There are several config files loacted in the folders config and config_sources.</p>"},{"location":"#general-configs","title":"General configs","text":"<p>The folder config contains two files. bbox.json is a collection of different bounding boxes for different areas. config.json contains the information on what assets to download, where to store the data, where the secrets are located, and for which years, and for which area (here the bboxes listed in bbox.json are used) the geospatial features should be downloaded.</p>"},{"location":"#secrets","title":"Secrets","text":"<p>To access climate and atmosphere data from Copernicus the necessary credentials need to be place into the configs_assets_folder defined in the config.json.
