One of the following methods was applied: in case of boundary changes between regions, the data was assigned to the equivalents as stated in the aforementioned list. In case of splits or mergings of regions and an indicator with absolute values, the data was weighted and distributed based on employment data of the respective (split or merged) regions. In case of mergings of regions into an indicator with relative values, the weighted average of the weighting indicator was used to determine the value for the merged region. In case of splits of regions an indicator with relative values, the same value as for the “parent” region was assigned to both new regions. | d-Values was recalculated from NUTS 2013 into NUTS 2016.
