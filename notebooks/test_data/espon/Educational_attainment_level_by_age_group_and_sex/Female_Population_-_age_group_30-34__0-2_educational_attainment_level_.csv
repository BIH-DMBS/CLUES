A list of changes of NUTS regions is provided by Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/nuts/history) and was the basis for the recalculation. One of the following methods was applied: in case of boundary changes between regions, the data was assigned to the equivalents as stated in the aforementioned list. In case of splits or mergings of regions and an indicator with absolute values, the data was weighted and distributed based on the population data of the respective (split or merged) regions. In case of mergings of regions into an indicator with relative values, the weighted average of the weighting indicator was used to determine the value for the merged region.

A list of changes of NUTS regions is provided by Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/nuts/history) and was the basis for the recalculation. One of the following methods was applied: in case of boundary changes between regions, the data was assigned to the equivalents as stated in the aforementioned list. In case of splits or mergings of regions and an indicator with absolute values, the data was weighted and distributed based on the population data of the respective (split or merged) regions. In case of mergings of regions into an indicator with relative values, the weighted average of the weighting indicator was used to determine the value for the merged region. In case of splits of regions an indicator with relative values, the same value as for the “parent” region was assigned to both new regions.","2-Database Eurostat : https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat | 3-value estimated based on either ESPON Database (Database Portal 2020) or Database Eurostat : https://database.espon.eu, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6.0","7.9","7.5","3.0","","","",""
