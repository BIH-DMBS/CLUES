In case of splits of regions an indicator with relative values, the same value as for the “parent” region was assigned to both new regions.","2-Database Eurostat : https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat | 3-value estimated based on either ESPON Database (Database Portal 2020) or Database Eurostat : https://database.espon.eu, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat","55.93303","62.8307512","66.928409","59.825802","59.552625","53.8159043","39.4741","24.99571","18.302871","23.15177","46.03035","63.78687","55.72814","50.74266","49.8","45.3","39.3","33.6","28.1","26.3","28.2","37.2"
